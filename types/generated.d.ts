 * DScrollPanel is a VGUI Element similar to DPanel however it has a vertical scrollbar docked to the right which can be used to put more content in a smaller area. DScrollPanels are essentially [DPanel](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DPanel)s with the Scroll Bar.
 *
 * This can be used to replace the [DPanelList](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DPanelList) with [DPanelList:EnableVerticalScrollbar](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DPanelList:EnableVerticalScrollbar) and get similar functionality as well as using a non-deprecated element.
 *
 * If you would like to paint or edit the elements of the scrollbar use [DScrollPanel:GetVBar](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DScrollPanel:GetVBar). If you want to see if the scrollbar is visible then use the VBar.Enabled variable on the scrollbar's VBar.

 * 		For example, in a two column layout, a item of height 2 units will be placed in one column while
 * 		two items of height 1 unit will be placed in the other column.
 *
 * 		It is worth noting however that because this panel iterates through its children in an undefined order and lays out while
 * 		it is iterating, there is no guarantee that this packing will lead to the lowest possible height.
 *
 * 		This is used by the spawnmenu to arrange spawnicons.
 *
 * 		The base size defines the smallest a tile can be, and it will resize vertically to accommodate all child panels.
 * 		The number of elements in each row is determined by the base size and width.

/**
 * These hooks are used inside of a Lua effect. Lua effects are stored in either the `/lua/effects` directory or in a gamemode in `/gamemodes/<gamemodename>/entities/effects`.
 *
 * Effects are entities with the classname `class CLuaEffect`, and as such, [Entity](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity) functions are usable on them (using the `self` argument).
 *
 * An `EFFECT` is made using either a combination of the [EFFECT:Init](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/EFFECT:Init), [EFFECT:Render](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/EFFECT:Render) and optionally the [EFFECT:Think](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/EFFECT:Think) hook. Another way is to create all particles in one go in the `Init` hook and don't use the other hooks at all.
 * <example>
 * 	<description>Creates a particle effect using a combination of the Init and the Think hooks.</description>
 * 	<code>
 * function EFFECT:Init( data )
 * 	-- Because CEffectData is a shared object, we can't just store it and use its' properties later
 * 	-- Instead, we store the properties themselves
 * 	self.offset = data:GetOrigin() + Vector( 0, 0, 0.2 )
 * 	self.angles = data:GetAngles()
 * 	self.particles = 4
 * end
 *
 * function EFFECT:Think()
 * 	return true
 * end
 *
 * function EFFECT:Render()
 * 	local emitter = ParticleEmitter( self.offset, false )
 * 		for i=0, self.particles do
 * 			local particle = emitter:Add( "effects/softglow", self.offset )
 * 			if particle then
 * 				particle:SetAngles( self.angles )
 * 				particle:SetVelocity( Vector( 0, 0, 15 ) )
 * 				particle:SetColor( 255, 102, 0 )
 * 				particle:SetLifeTime( 0 )
 * 				particle:SetDieTime( 0.2 )
 * 				particle:SetStartAlpha( 255 )
 * 				particle:SetEndAlpha( 0 )
 * 				particle:SetStartSize( 1.6 )
 * 				particle:SetStartLength( 1 )
 * 				particle:SetEndSize( 1.2 )
 * 				particle:SetEndLength( 4 )
 * 			end
 * 		end
 * 	emitter:Finish()
 * end
 * 	</code>
 *
 * </example>
 *
 * <example>
 * 	<description>Creates a particle effect using only the Init hook. To use this effect in a loop one needs to create a new instance of this effect every drawn frame.</description>
 * 	<code>
 * function EFFECT:Init( data )
 * 	local vOffset = data:GetOrigin() + Vector( 0, 0, 0.2 )
 * 	local vAngle = data:GetAngles()
 * 	local emitter = ParticleEmitter( vOffset, false )

 * An [eagerly evaluated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eager_evaluation) [ternary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:), or, in layman's terms, a compact "if then else" statement.
 *
 * In most cases, you should just use Lua's ["pseudo" ternary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:#Lua), like this:
 *
 * ```
 * local myCondition = true
 * local consequent = "myCondition is true"
 * local alternative = "myCondition is false"
 *
 * print(myCondition and consequent or alternative)
 * ```
 *
 * In the above example, due to [short-circuit evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation), `consequent` would be "skipped" and ignored (not evaluated) by Lua due to `myCondition` being `true`, and only `alternative` would be evaluated. However, when using `Either`, both `consequent` and `alternative` would be evaluated. A practical example of this can be found at the bottom of the page.
 *
 * # Falsey values
 *
 * If `consequent` is "falsey" (Lua considers both `false` and `nil` as false), this will not work. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * local X = true
 * local Y = false
 * local Z = "myCondition is false"
 *
 * print(X and Y or Z)
 * ```
 *
 * This will actually print the value of `Z`.
 *
 * In the above case, and other very rare cases, you may find `Either` useful.

 * The string *type* is a sequence of characters.

 * The string *library* is a standard Lua library which provides functions for the manipulation of strings.[[1]](https://www.lua.org/pil/20.html)
 *
 * In Garry's Mod there are several extra useful functions and features added to this library.<br/>
 * Most notably all strings will access this library through the string metatable index function.[[2]](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod/blob/master/garrysmod/lua/includes/extensions/string.lua#L311-L322)
 *
 * This means all strings are treated like table objects and the string library as its <page text="Meta Table">Meta_Tables</page>
 *
 * ```lua
 * local x = "Kittens"
 * function string.Foobar(self) return self:Right(4) end
 *
 * string.Right(x,4) == x:Right(4) == x:Foobar() == ("Kittens"):Right(4) == x[-4]..x[-3]..x[-2]..x[-1]
 * ```
 *
 * The string *metatable* however is something else, and to access that you must use `getmetatable("")`.
 *
 * The difference here is related to [Metamethods](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Metamethods), such as using (+) instead of (..) to concatenate strings.
 *
 * This category lists functions available in the string *library*.
 *
 * **Warning:**
 * >Using `+` operator for concatenation breaks lua metamethod to sum string as numbers (Example: `"10" + "1"` return `11` (number)) and this is 400 times SLOWER!
 *
 * **Warning:**
 * >Making changes to the string *metatable* is not a good idea unless you know what you are doing. Use the string *library* instead.

     *
     * **Note:**
     * >If you find that `surface.DrawTexturedRectUV` is getting your texture coordinates (u0, v0), (u1, v1) wrong and you're rendering with a material created with [Global.CreateMaterial](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.CreateMaterial), try adjusting them with the following code:
     *
     * ```
     * local du = 0.5 / 32 -- half pixel anticorrection
     * local dv = 0.5 / 32 -- half pixel anticorrection
     * local u0, v0 = (u0 - du) / (1 - 2 * du), (v0 - dv) / (1 - 2 * dv)
     * local u1, v1 = (u1 - du) / (1 - 2 * du), (v1 - dv) / (1 - 2 * dv)
     * ```
     *
     * **Explanation:**
     * `surface.DrawTexturedRectUV` tries to correct the texture coordinates by half a pixel (something to do with sampling) and computes the correction using `IMaterial::GetMappingWidth()`/`GetMappingHeight()`. If the material was created without a `$basetexture`, then `GetMappingWidth()`/`GetMappingHeight()` uses the width and height of the error material (which is 32x32).
