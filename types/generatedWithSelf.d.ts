     *
     * Registers a function (or "callback") with the [Hook](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Hook) system so that it will be called automatically whenever a specific event (or "hook") occurs.
     * @param eventName - The event to hook on to. This can be any <page text="GM">GM_Hooks</page> hook, gameevent after using [gameevent.Listen](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/gameevent.Listen), or custom hook run with [hook.Call](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/hook.Call) or [hook.Run](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/hook.Run).
     * @param identifier - The unique identifier, usually a string. This can be used elsewhere in the code to replace or remove the hook. The identifier **should** be unique so that you do not accidentally override some other mods hook, unless that's what you are trying to do.
     * 			The identifier can be either a [string](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/string), or a [table](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/table)/object with an IsValid function defined such as an [Entity](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity) or [Panel](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Panel). [number](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/number)s and [boolean](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/boolean)s, for example, are not allowed.
     * 			If the identifier is a table/object, it will be inserted in front of the other arguments in the callback and the hook will be called as long as it's valid. However, if IsValid( identifier ) returns false when **any** eventName hook is called, the hook will be removed.
     * @param func - The function to be called, arguments given to it depend on the identifier used.
     * **Warning:**
     * >Returning any value besides nil from the hook's function will stop other hooks of the same event down the loop from being executed. Only return a value when absolutely necessary and when you know what you are doing.
     * 				It will also prevent the associated `GM:*` hook from being called on the gamemode.
     * 				It WILL break other addons.
